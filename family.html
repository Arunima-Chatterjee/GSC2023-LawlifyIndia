        <div class="thefront"><h1>The Indian Succession Act</h1></div>

        <div class="theback"><h1>1925</h1><p>The documents purporting to be a Will or a testament must be legal, i.e. in conformity with the law and must be executed by a person legally competent to make it and it must be signed and attested, as required by law.

 

The declaration should relate to disposition of the property of the person making the Will.
A will becomes enforceable only after the death of the testator. It gives absolutely no rights to the legatee (the person who inherits) until the death of the testator. It has no effect during the lifetime of the testator.
The testator can change his will, at any time prior to his death, in any manner he deems fit. The essence of every Will is that it is revocable during the lifetime of the testator.</p>

        <div class="theback"><h1>1954</h1><p>Although marriage is seen as a deeply religious and ceremonious affair by many, some prefer to get married in a way that is not governed by the religion-based laws. This is especially the case with inter-caste or inter-religious marriages as it is more convenient to retain oneâ€™s religion and marry legally than convert for the sake of a legally valid marriage under the religion-based acts. Under the Special Marriage Act, marriage is treated as a civil contract.</p>
